<h1>Games and projects</h1>

<p>My most well known fighting game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1287800/Schwarzerblitz/">Schwarzerblitz</a>, freely available on Steam, itch.io and GameJolt. Schwarzerblitz is a love letter to '90s polygonal fighting games, with 27 playable characters and a 5 hours long story mode. The game has been praised for its story and gameplay (97% positive rate on 111 reviews, as of December 2021).</p>

<p>My current fighting game project is <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/motionsickness/601247">Motionsickness</a>, freely available on GameJolt and currently in open alpha. Motionsickness is a more experimental game, based around the idea of having access to very complicate motions to deal massive damage or simplfied, Smash Bros. like, commands that favor practicality and consistency over damage.</p>
