<h1>Welcome to the far side of the Moon</h1>
<p>My name is Andrea Demetrio - video game developer and 
writer for <a href="https://supercombo.gg/author/andreajens/">SuperCombo.gg</a>. With four years of experience in the indie fighting game community, both as a developer and a reporter, I have decided to offer my help to other game makers that might be stuck on some design issues.</p>

<p>Do you need a story writer for avoiding the <em>"evil guy holds martial arts tournament"</em> excuse plot? Would you like to have some clever dialogue options and meaningful character interactions? Are you planning to flesh out your world but you don't know where to start? <a href="./services.html#story">This is the right place for you</a>!</p>

<p>Are you having troubles in defining which moves to give to your cool characters? Need ideas for a super? Stuck on deciding which frame data to apply to which move? <a href="./services.html#moveset">I can help there too</a>!</p>
