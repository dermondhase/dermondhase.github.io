<h2 id="story">Story writing and dialogue editing</h2>
<p>Fighting game stories are known to be mostly excuse plots, with some relevant exceptions. 
It might be hard to build a coherent narrative that showcases all characters without feeling forced... and this is where I come into play. 
World-building? Dialogue writing? Story pacing? You can contact me for a first consultancy free of charge. 
All the relevant details in the practical infographic below! </p>

<h2 id="moveset">Moveset design</h2>
<p>
Sometimes, deciding which move might fit a character isn't an easy process. How to make each character unique? 
How to underline their strengths and their weaknesses through their movesets? How to showcase their personalities just by means of their motion?
This is where I offer you my expertise! Consultancy rates depend on the level of detail required.
