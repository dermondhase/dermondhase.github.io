<h2 id="moveset">Moveset design</h2>
<p>
Sometimes, deciding which move might fit a character isn't an easy process. How to make each character unique? 
How to underline their strengths and their weaknesses through their movesets? How to showcase their personalities just by means of their motion?
This is where I offer you my expertise! Consultancy rates depend on the level of detail required.
